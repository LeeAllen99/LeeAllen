  <p>LOVE STORY </p>
  <b>
     You don’t know. 
    You might be living your life not knowing. 
    That there’s someone out there who still remembers you, you come across their minds because you were 
    unique and special like no one they’ve met before. And they know what they lost when they lost you they
     just can’t take the step of getting in touch exactly as you can’t take it. Because both of you know it’s over, 
     nothing to get back to. You don’t know perhaps
    You are not the only one moving on with past ghosts on mind, perhaps you’re someone’s past ghost too
